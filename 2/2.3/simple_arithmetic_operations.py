# Description: This program performs simple arithmetic operations on two numbers.
num1 = 10
num2 = 5

sum = num1 + num2
difference = num1 - num2
product = num1 * num2
quotient = num1 / num2

print(f"The sum of {num1} and {num2} is {sum}")
print(f"The difference between {num1} and {num2} is {difference}")
print(f"The product of {num1} and {num2} is {product}")
print(f"The quotient of {num1} and {num2} is {quotient}")
