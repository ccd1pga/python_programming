# 1. Write a Python program to test whether a number is positive or negative.
x = 5

if x > 0:
    print("x is positive")
else:
    print("x is not positive")

# 2. Write a Python program create a variable
name = "Alice"
age = 30

# 3. Write a statement
x = 5 # assigment statement
print(x) # function call statement

# 4. Write an expression
3 + 4
x * 2
x > 0

# Basic dta types and operators
# Arithmetic operations
x = 5 + 3 # addition
y = 7 - 2 # subtraction
z = 4 * 2 # multiplication
a = 9 / 3 # division

# Comparison operations
b = 5 > 3 # greater than
c = 4 < 2 # less than
d = 5 == 5 # equal to
e = 5 != 3 # not equal to

# Logical operations
f = True and False # logical AND
g = True or False # logical OR
h not True # logical NOT
